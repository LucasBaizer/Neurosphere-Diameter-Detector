# 1.5 Configuring

We can customize the application a little bit for more accurate results.

At the top menu bar, select *Data*, and then *Measurements*. 
This will pop up with a dialog. Here, you can set the conversion rate of pixels to micrometers.

The inputs are mostly self-explanatory-- the amount of pixels goes on the left, and the amount of micrometers on the right.

At the bottom, there are two buttons, *Cancel* and *Save & Close*.
Canceling closes the dialog and does not change the conversion rate.
Saving and closing saves the conversion rate, and then closes the dialog.
