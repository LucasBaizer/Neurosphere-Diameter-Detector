# 1.2 Basic Usage

In this section, the basic mechanics of how to detect organoids in an image will be covered.
<br />
As briefly mentioned in [1.1 Introduction]($LOCAL/Introduction.md), there are 3 image components on the screen.
The leftmost one is the *input image*. This is where a picture of organoids is input to be scanned.
There are 3 ways to input an image into this image component:

	1. Navigate to the File menu in the toolbar, and then click on Open.
	   You can also use the shortcut for this, which is Ctrl+O.
	   A file explorer will pop up, and you can navigate to image that you want to use.
	   Currently, PNG, JPG, BMP, and GIF formats are supported.
	2. Another way to input a file is my clicking on the first image component.
	   This will also open a file explorer.
	3. The third way to input a file is by dragging an image file into the first image component.
       For example, in your system's file explorer, an image file can be dragged onto the first image component.
	
Once an image is input, we can see that there's some data already displayed above the image component.
