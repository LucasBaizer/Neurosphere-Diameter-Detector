# About
	
This application was created by [Lucas Baizer](https://github.com/LucasBaizer) for the University of California San Diego (UCSD).
<br />
The opportunity to create this software was provided by [Dr. Lilia M. Iakoucheva, PhD](http://iakouchevalab.ucsd.edu/),  who works in the Department of Psychiatry at the UCSD School of Medicine.
<br />
Dr. Iakoucheva proposed the idea of the application to the [League of Amazing Programmers](http://www.jointheleague.org), a local school which teachers kids programming.
<br />
Lucas, a graduate of the school and a teacher's assistant, created the application after informed of the opporunity by the League's head teacher, Keith Groves.
