# 1.1 Introduction

Upon loading the application, you will notice several things: a menu bar at the top, and below that, there are 3 large, empty rectangles.
These rectangles are image components, which are explained in [1.2 Basic Usage]($LOCAL/BasicUsage.md).
Below the first image component, there are some parameters, which are also explained more in-depth in section 1.2.
<br />
In the menu bar, there are 3 menus- File, Data, and Help.
The File menu is discussed in section 1.2, and the Data menu is discussed in [1.5 Configuring]($LOCAL/Configuring.md).
The Help menu is used to get where you are right now-- the documentation!
It also has a bit about this application, and all the necessary licensing for this applicaton and the libraries it uses.
