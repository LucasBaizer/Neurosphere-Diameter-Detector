# 1.4 Exporting Data

Once the output detections are all properly set up, we can export a CSV report.

On the right side of the output image component, press the *Export* button.
This will pop up with a dialog which will help you export a CSV report.

The first item is the *Save Directory*. This is the folder on your computer that the CSV report will be saved to.
To change it, press the *Change* button.

The second item is the *File Name*. This is name of the CSV report. It defaults to the name of the input image.

The third item is the CSV file delimiter. There are currently 3 options: *Comma* (,) *Tab* (	) and *Pipe* (|).

The last items are two buttons, *Cancel* and *Export*. Canceling closes the export dialog.
Exporting creates a CSV file according to the input parameters.
